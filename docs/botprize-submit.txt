Please also consider my #BotPrize entry @ExDemoAuthBot, which demonstrates the use of the Telegram Bot platform for authentication and authorisation. We can thereby avoid the usual web-based signup, verify email and signin. Rather, a /login message from a Telegram.org user is sufficient. The user authentication is effectively delegated to Telegram.org. The "auth bot" then provides a magic login link to itself, to set a cookie on the domain and redirect to the web app. The code (https://github.com/evanx/authbot) is opensource and intended to be generically reusable for any web domain.
